# Flask Start-up / Example App

## Introduction

Flask is great, but getting going is sometimes a little bit of a pain.  Having to remember that you need these dependencies and a templates folder and a starter template and so on is just a bit of a niggle at best, and a real pain in the backside at worst, so having a "start point" that you can check out, delete the .git stuff and re-initialise as a new project and iterate from there on in is a really useful thing to have.

## Usage

Just clone the repo (proabably specifying a folder-name in the clone command), delete the .git folder and then re-initialise the git repo with a `git init`.

Now iterate on the code - via con Dios!
